# Metrics

In the metrics.py file some custom metrics are implemented and can be used by putting them without quotation marks into the config.json file as loss function. If the keras implementation of a metric is wished to be used set the metric with quotation marks as the loss function.

Metrics which can be used from keras are:
- "mse" or "mean_squared_error"
- "mae" or "mean_absolute_error"
- "mape" or "mean_absolute_percentage_error"
- "msle" or "mean_squared_logarithmic_error"
- "accuracy"
- "binary_crossentropy"
- "categorical_accuracy"
- "sparse_categorical_accuracy"
- "top_k_categorical_accuracy"
- "sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy"
- "cosine_proximity"
- "hinge"
- "squared_hinge"
- "categorical_hinge"
- "kullback_leibler_divergence"
- "Huber"

Custom losses include:
- dice_loss
- dice_coef_loss_crossentropy
- total_variation_loss
- total_variaton_loss_mse
- dice_mse
- binary_crossentropy_mse
- binary_crossentropy_dice

Names with two losses in them are the sum of the two. For details please open the python file.
